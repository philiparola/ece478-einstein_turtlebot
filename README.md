## Project Requirements
Project 1 is due Monday November 5.  You can and should use software from previous classes that is on D2L, software from Melih and from Internet. Just write what software you use and for what. 

The minimum requirements for Human on Mobile Base robots are the following:
1.	Robot muse be able to move forward, backward, left, right, turn around, dance.
2.	Robot must have some simple body gestures like greeting, hello, good bye, shake hand, etc.
3.	Robot must have speech capabilities: word or sentence recognition and text to speech.

5.	Robot must use some type of Machine Learning, Evolutionary algorithm, neural net or fuzzy logic. Take it from previous projects and integrate.
6.	You have to deliver 3 items: (1) report in Word, (2) presentation in PowerPoint, (3) video. Report must be inclusive and the role of each student from the team should be clear. PPT presentation must allow you to deliver a good speech in front of class, what did you achieve, what else you want to learn.

## Platform
This project is for the [TurtleBot2](https://www.turtlebot.com/turtlebot2/).  (From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TurtleBot)) TurtleBot is a low-cost, personal robot kit with open source software. TurtleBot was created at Willow Garage by Melonee Wise and Tully Foote in November 2010.  The TurtleBot kit consists of a mobile base, 3D Sensor, laptop computer, and the TurtleBot mounting hardware kit. In addition to the TurtleBot kit, users can download the TurtleBot SDK from the ROS wiki.

The TurtleBot2 uses [ROS Kinetic](http://wiki.ros.org/kinetic/Installation) as its software platform.
